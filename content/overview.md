Contributing to the Docker project or to any open source project can be a
rewarding experience. You help yourself and your help projects you are working on, as
well as the countless number of other project participants.

Open source projects depend on a lot more than just code to be
successful. Proper documentation, testing, training, publicity, support and
organization are all critical.
