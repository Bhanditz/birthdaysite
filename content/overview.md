# ![Docker Party](/images/docker-friends.png)

Contributing to the Docker project or to any open source project can be a
rewarding experience. You help yourself and you help the projects you work on.
You also help the countless number of other project participants.

Open source projects depend on a lot more than just code to be successful.
Proper documentation, testing, training, publicity, support and organization are
all critical.

# New to Docker? Before you arrive at an event...

If you have time, here are some things you can do get a head start before an event:

* Learn a little about what Docker is.
	* [Video review of Docker
	fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRLyovWi1gs) (9 minutes)
	* [Other good Docker resources](http://www.nkode.io/2014/08/24/valuable-docker-links.html)
* Test your knowledge.
	* [Basic Dockerfile test](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/level1/)
	* [Advanced Dockerfile test](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/level2/)
*  [Install Docker](http://docs.docker.com/introduction/#installation) on your machine.
* Get a free [GitHub account](https://github.com).
* Sure you want to contribute code or docs? Work through the [project
contributors guide](http://docs.docker.com/project/who-written-for/).
