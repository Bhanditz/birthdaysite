From March 23rd through April 19th any contributions made to the Docker Project
will count toward Docker’s donation to the Oceanic Society and its mission to
conserve the habitat of Moby Dock and blue whales across the planet. We will be
putting a guide on how to participate in this online “open-source-a-thon” on
http://docker.party. Like the in person events, the docker project team members
and expert developers from the broader open source community will teach and
guide participants on how to contribute to open source. There will be dedicated
online communication channels for people new to contributing to open source and
new to Docker. 

There is no specific date and time for the online event and consequently no
RSVP is needed. It is open to everyone with even the smallest desire to be a
part open source or people who just want to help out with a great cause
regardless of technical experience. 

If you are interested in mentoring then please RSVP on the meetup page and sign
up to be a mentor at http://goo.gl/forms/TAFVpnh3K8

If you are interested in hosting a local event or want information, please
email party@docker.com so we can provide you with the right material and list
it on our website.
