A tutorial is a step-by-step guide for accomplishing some Docker task. For
example, Digital Ocean produces a lot of <a href="http://goo.gl/mHq6bt"
target="_blank">high quality tutorials</a> for development and sysadmin tasks.

Contribute a tutorial if you accomplished a difficult or interesting Docker
task&mdash;document it for yourself and others!  Choose this task if you don't
want to learn Git or GitHub. You can write a tutorial in your own
blog space or in your favorite documentation editor.


# What is a tutorial?

* Walks a user through a real-world example.
* Requires a user to complete one or more procedures.
* A procedure has one or more ordered steps (1, 2, 3...).
* Most every step has an expected "result"; so readers can check their work.

# How to contribute a tutorial

1. Pick a tutorial area.  

	Rather than picking the `docker/docker` project maybe try writing a tutorial
	for one of our other projects:

	* <a href="https://github.com/docker/machine" target="_blank">Machine</a>
	* <a href="https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic" target="_blank">Kitematic</a>
	* <a href="https://github.com/docker/swarm" target="_blank">Swarm</a>
	* <a href="https://github.com/docker/compose" target="_blank">Compose</a>
	
2. Pick a tutorial topic.

	Can't come up with something? Leverage your knowledge of one product to try
	something new on another. Using Docker Swarm you should be able to take a task
	you can do one Docker host and do it across several hosts all at once. You can
	also check our list of <a href="http://goo.gl/BqbsS4" target="_blank">open
	writing issues</a> for ideas.
  	
3. Write up your tutorial.

	You can do this on a blog, in Markdown, or even in your favorite Document editor.

4. Submit the URL to us on <a href="https://twitter.com/docker"
target="_blank">ping us on twitter</a> or if you wrote in a file, drop the file off 
<a href="https://dev.dockerproject.com/c/share" target="_blank">on our Discourse
share</a>.
