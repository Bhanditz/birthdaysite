Docker is a very large project with a lot of things moving at all
times. One of the best ways to begin getting involved is to help us
organize our work.


Triage, the process of reviewing incoming issue tickets, gathering more
information about the situation, and verifying whether or not the report
is valid is a critical part of the day-to-day operation of all of our
projects. 

Some new tickets are valuable reports of broken behavior, others are
suggestions for enhancements both large and small, and some are, in
fact, not bugs at all. Identifying which issues are which and
facilitating timely communication between the reporter and the
contributors whose input is necessary to resolve the problem are all
parts of the triage process.

# Why Triage?

For a newcomer, triage is a natural way to find the pulse of a project
and see what other contributors will be thinking about on any given day
(because they're also helping with triage), as well as interacting with
the team and making yourself part of the process! It's also a good way
to increase the breadth of your exposure to a particular project; the
process of verifying bugs will encourage in-depth looks at parts of code
and functionality with which you weren't already familiar. And if you're
hoping to eventually contribute code, helping with triage is a great way
to identify the bugs that need to be fixed and observe how others go
about solving similar problems.

# How Do I Help?

The Docker Project keep track of issues, bugs and feature requests using
GitHub issues. All you have to do is sign up for a GitHub account if you
don't already have one. From there on out, it's as simple as "watching"
the repositories you want to help triage. New issues and comments will
make their way to your notification center and inbox, depending on your
notification settings.

# Triage Workflow

1. Docker issues that need triaging will have the label “Needs Triage”
   applied to them.
2. Review the issue ticket and reply politely with an appropriate
   response based on the situation. You may need to ask for more
   information, a simplified test case (or a test case at all),
   duplicate the reported behavior using a provided test case (or
   reducing one further), or direct the reporter to the right venue for
   their issue.
3. Apply the right labels by commenting on the issue. GorBot, our very
   own robot will review your comment and apply the labels as necessary.
4. Participate in the discussion as it continues, as necessary.
