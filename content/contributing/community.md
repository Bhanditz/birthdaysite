**In a sense, each method of contributing to Docker is also contributing to the
community**.  A community is formed by being with and talking to people either
in person or electronically through email, IM, or other means. Contributing to
community is helping to make any aspect of using Docker projects better for
*other* people.

# User Support

Working on Q & A is awesome for a number of reasons, one of which is the
simple act of helping others, and sharing in the camaraderie that comes
with being part of an open source project. Over time, the nicknames and
handles of strangers may come to be familiar mentors, mentees, and
friends.

Users look for help on the [user support forum](https://forum.docker.com)
and on the #Docker IRC channel on Freenode.
