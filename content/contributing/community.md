*In a sense, each of the different ways of getting involved that we
detail on this site are all ways of contributing to the Docker
community, which we define quite liberally: helping to make any aspect
of using Docker projects better for other people. This, of
course, includes things like filing and fixing bugs, but the discussion
on this page focuses on just some of the ways you can help have an
impact on the people part of that definition!*

# User Support

Working on Q & A is awesome for a number of reasons, one of which is the
simple act of helping others, and sharing in the camaraderie that comes
with being part of an open source project. Over time, the nicknames and
handles of strangers may come to be familiar mentors, mentees, and
friends.

Users look for help on the [user support forum](https://forum.docker.com)
