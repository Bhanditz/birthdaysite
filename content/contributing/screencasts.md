Many people are visual learners. These people learn best from pictures, maps,
and other visual media&mdash;like video.  If that sounds like you, you might
also like to contribute visually by submitting a screencast.  (Not sure what kind of learner you are, <a

**FACT**:  ~65% of the population are visual learners.


# What kind screencast?

* Create a screencast <a href="http://goo.gl/5h3zv1"
target="_blank">demonstrating a basic Docker task</a>. 
* You can help by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yE-MDb-JWSQ"
target="_blank">video taping another person's presentation</a>.  (Get
permission!)
* Convert a Docker presentation/talk you've created into a screencast.

# How to contribute screencast

1. Decide what you want to portray.

	You might want to search in Youtube or <a href="https://vimeo.com/tag:docker"
	target="_blank">Vimeo</a> for Docker and see what other people have already
	done. Then, choose something different or update something outdated. You
	could also choose to do a screencast that <a href="http://goo.gl/Nzat9v"
	target="_blank">depicts a new enhancement</a>.

2.  If you don't have any, get some screencast software.

	There are <a href="http://goo.gl/i1ZCaY" target="_blank">several free
	screencasting tools</a> available.
	
3.  Create your screencast.

4. <a href="http://goo.gl/T0aSqd" target="_blank">License the output</a> to Docker. 

5.  Optionally, write a `README.txt` file to explain your work.

	For example, if the cast should go into a specific point in the
	documentation, explain where. Also, include the document's URL in your
	README.  

6.  Submit the source file(s), `README.txt`, and completed license <a
href="https://dev.dockerproject.com/c/share" target="_blank">on our Discourse share</a>.
