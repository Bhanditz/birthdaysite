With millions of Docker users all over the world, there's always someone who
needs a helping hand. Like many open source projects, the Docker project relies
on community support channels like forums, IRC, and StackOverflow.  You should
contribute mentoring if you have good knowledge:

* how open source projects run
* using Docker in some particular domain (for example, testing or deployment)
* specific knowledge about Git, Go, or other aspects of coding
* experience with GitHub, IRC, or other common tools

Also, choose mentoring if you like to be happy. Studies show that <a

give your own mood a boost.


# Where to help

If you are reading this at a Docker birthday event, look around you.  Is there
someone who looks puzzled or frustrated? Smile at this person and say "Hey, can
I help you with something?"   Below are some other places to help:

## Docker users

Docker users are people using Docker in their daily work. For example, a user
