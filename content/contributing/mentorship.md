With millions of Docker users all over the world, there's always someone
out there who needs a helping hand. Like many open source projects, the
Docker Project relies on community support channels like forums, IRC,
and StackOverflow. Helping out with support is one of the best first
steps you can take to get involved in any open source community, and is
a great way to contribute on an ongoing basis.
