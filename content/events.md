The Docker Project, the open platform for distributed applications, is
organizing an open-source-a-thon, where Docker core team members will teach and
mentor people on how to contribute to open source. Contributions include code,
documentation, tutorials, videos, and mentoring. Each contribution to the
Docker Project will also support the [Oceanic Society](http://www.oceanicsociety.org) and its mission to
conserve oceans.

## Additional open-source-a-thon’s

Thanks to overwhelming response and support, the event series is expanding to
both online and community events!

Many community organizers reached out to us to see if they could host local
events themselves in cities that, due to logistic and resource constraints, we
simply couldn’t staff ourselves. These community events will use the same
material as the other events and will provide mentorship from expert developers
from the broader open source community. 

Like the official events, any contributions made to the Docker Project at these
events and in the weeks following will count toward Docker’s donation to the
Oceanic Society.

If you are interested in hosting a local event, or want more information,
please email party@docker.com so we can provide you with the right materials
and list it on our website.

We will list these events here once the dates are finalized.

# Charity

The program is timed to coincide with the project’s 2nd birthday and is focused
on a cause – ocean and marine life health – that is important to its millions
of users. Docker’s logo, Moby Dock, is a blue whale that was contributed and
selected by its community.  The charitable program starts on March 23 and will
span a total of five weeks; part of the proceeds will go towards the adoption
and naming of a female blue whale soon to be known as “Molly Dock.” 


Contributions from the “opening week” of the program and follow-on
contributions over the subsequent four weeks will be calculated and the final
donation will be made. One contribution equates to a $50 donation, and an
additional $50 will be added to the “Molly Dock fund” for those that wish to
continue to contribute.
